# A deep learning inference engine for Go

This project intends to make trained models, such as AlexNet, GoogleNet, etc., accessible within Go.  It utilizes the functionality of Intel's inference engine (part of the deep learning SDK) to interact with trained and optimized neural networks. 

This is work in progress.  An official release is forthcoming.
